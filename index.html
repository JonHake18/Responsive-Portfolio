                        I am a driven, family-oriented man that loves to take challenges head-on and grow from the experience. I work as a forensic scientist in a toxicology lab however, technology and coding has always held a special place in my heart. I began coding 15 years ago in middle and high school but didn't pursue it as a career due to a desire to keep the thing I love as a hobby and not a career. I'm ready to love my career.
                    <br><br>
                        When I'm not working or coding for class I love to spend my time with my wonderful wife Theresa and our lovable giant Moose, he's a 90 pound english pointer mix. I love listening to music and what is left of my free time after family is used playing computer games such as: Path of Exile, Dota 2, and Rocket League.
                    <br><br>
                        I look forward to pursuing the challenges presented in full stack web development and the joy that comes with conquering those challenges. Please enjoy my portfolio for a representation of skills and contact me for further inquiries.
